# Abstract
This paper presents **EduConnect**, an AI-powered Learning Management System integrating secure authentication, intelligent tutoring, and real-time collaboration to enhance modern education.

# 1. Introduction
Digital learning platforms are essential in modern education, but existing systems face fragmentation, security issues, and lack of intelligence. EduConnect addresses these challenges by combining LMS capabilities with advanced AI assistance.

## Problem Statement
- **Fragmentation**: Students use disparate tools for notes, quizzes, and class management.
- **Security**: Many ed-tech platforms lack robust session management.
- **Lack of Intelligence**: Standard LMS platforms are static and do not offer personalized help.

# 2. Related Work
Existing LMS platforms focus primarily on content delivery (e.g., Moodle, Canvas). Recent research integrates AI, but often lacks security constraints or a unified design system. EduConnect bridges this gap.
